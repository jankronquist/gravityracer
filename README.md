# Gravity Racer

Minimalistic "Thrust" game where you race a space ship in a cave.

Play here: https://jankronquist.itch.io/gravityracer

## Overview

The game is difficult. Walls will kill you instantly so you need to be careful. Try getting to the first checkpoint and then start improving your time.

Controls:

```
Space = Thrust
Left/Right = Rotate the ship
```

## Design and inspiration

Made for [Blackthornprod GAME JAM #3](https://itch.io/jam/blackthornprod-game-jam-3) with the theme "Less is more". After watching the [video about game feel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsGuN69g2NI) I got inspire to focus on only game feel. This lead me to:

* Only use rectangles (less graphics)
* No hit points, one hit and you are dead (less life)
* Only one level

I have always wanted to make a more modern version of my game [Gravity Force 20](https://www.gravityforce20.com/)

## Future ideas

* Add fuel that you need to pick up, but less fuel = less weight = faster
* More levels
* Global highscores
